## REVERSE LL

Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

Example 1:

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [5,4,3,2,1]

Example 2:

Input: head = [1,2]
Output: [2,1]

Example 3:

Input: head = []
Output: []

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is the range [0, 5000].
-5000 <= Node.val <= 5000


Follow up: A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?

### solution

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None


class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        prev, curr = None, head

        while curr:
            temp = curr.next
            curr.next = prev
            prev = curr
            curr = temp
        return prev
```



## MERGE TWO SORTED LISTS

You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2.
Merge the two lists in a one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.
Return the head of the merged linked list.

Example 1:

Input: list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]

Example 2:

Input: list1 = [], list2 = []
Output: []

Example 3:

Input: list1 = [], list2 = [0]
Output: [0]

Constraints:

The number of nodes in both lists is in the range [0, 50].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
Both list1 and list2 are sorted in non-decreasing order.

### solution

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def mergeTwoLists(self, list1: ListNode, list2: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        dummy = ListNode()
        tail = dummy

        while list1 and list2:
            if list1.val < list2.val:
                tail.next = list1
                list1 = list1.next
            else:
                tail.next = list2
                list2 = list2.next
            tail = tail.next

        if list1:
            tail.next = list1
        elif list2:
            tail.next = list2

        return dummy.next
```



## REORDER LISTS

You are given the head of a singly linked-list. The list can be represented as:
L0 → L1 → … → Ln - 1 → Ln
Reorder the list to be on the following form:
L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln - 1 → L2 → Ln - 2 → …
You may not modify the values in the list's nodes. Only nodes themselves may be changed.

Example 1:

Input: head = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [1,4,2,3]

Example 2:

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [1,5,2,4,3]

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 5 * 104].
1 <= Node.val <= 1000

### solution

```python
class Solution:
    def reorderList(self, head: ListNode) -> None:
        # find middle
        slow, fast = head, head.next
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next

        # reverse second half
        second = slow.next
        prev = slow.next = None
        while second:
            tmp = second.next
            second.next = prev
            prev = second
            second = tmp

        # merge two halfs
        first, second = head, prev
        while second:
            tmp1, tmp2 = first.next, second.next
            first.next = second
            second.next = tmp1
            first, second = tmp1, tmp2
```



## REMOVE NTH NODE FROM END OF LIST

Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.

Example 1:

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
Output: [1,2,3,5]

Example 2:

Input: head = [1], n = 1
Output: []

Example 3:

Input: head = [1,2], n = 1
Output: [1]

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is sz.
1 <= sz <= 30
0 <= Node.val <= 100
1 <= n <= sz

Follow up: Could you do this in one pass?

### solution

```python
class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: ListNode, n: int) -> ListNode:
        dummy = ListNode(0, head)
        left = dummy
        right = head

        while n > 0:
            right = right.next
            n -= 1

        while right:
            left = left.next
            right = right.next

        # delete
        left.next = left.next.next
        return dummy.next
```



## COPY LIST WITH RANDOM POINTER

A linked list of length n is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer, which could point to any node in the list, or null.
Construct a deep copy of the list. The deep copy should consist of exactly n brand new nodes, where each new node has its value set to the value of its corresponding original node. Both the next and random pointer of the new nodes should point to new nodes in the copied list such that the pointers in the original list and copied list represent the same list state. None of the pointers in the new list should point to nodes in the original list.
For example, if there are two nodes X and Y in the original list, where X.random --> Y, then for the corresponding two nodes x and y in the copied list, x.random --> y.
Return the head of the copied linked list.
The linked list is represented in the input/output as a list of n nodes. Each node is represented as a pair of [val, random_index] where:
val: an integer representing Node.val
random_index: the index of the node (range from 0 to n-1) that the random pointer points to, or null if it does not point to any node.
Your code will only be given the head of the original linked list.

Example 1:

Input: head = [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]
Output: [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]

Example 2:

Input: head = [[1,1],[2,1]]
Output: [[1,1],[2,1]]

Example 3:

Input: head = [[3,null],[3,0],[3,null]]
Output: [[3,null],[3,0],[3,null]]

Constraints:

0 <= n <= 1000
-104 <= Node.val <= 104
Node.random is null or is pointing to some node in the linked list.

### solution

```python
"""
# Definition for a Node.
class Node:
    def __init__(self, x: int, next: 'Node' = None, random: 'Node' = None):
        self.val = int(x)
        self.next = next
        self.random = random
"""


class Solution:
    def copyRandomList(self, head: "Node") -> "Node":
        oldToCopy = {None: None}

        cur = head
        while cur:
            copy = Node(cur.val)
            oldToCopy[cur] = copy
            cur = cur.next
        cur = head
        while cur:
            copy = oldToCopy[cur]
            copy.next = oldToCopy[cur.next]
            copy.random = oldToCopy[cur.random]
            cur = cur.next
        return oldToCopy[head]
```



## ADD TWO NUMBERS

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.
You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

Example 1:

Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [7,0,8]
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.

Example 2:

Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]

Example 3:

Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]
Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]

Constraints:

The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range [1, 100].
0 <= Node.val <= 9
It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.

### solution

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def addTwoNumbers(self, l1: ListNode, l2: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        dummy = ListNode()
        cur = dummy

        carry = 0
        while l1 or l2 or carry:
            v1 = l1.val if l1 else 0
            v2 = l2.val if l2 else 0

            # new digit
            val = v1 + v2 + carry
            carry = val // 10
            val = val % 10
            cur.next = ListNode(val)

            # update ptrs
            cur = cur.next
            l1 = l1.next if l1 else None
            l2 = l2.next if l2 else None

        return dummy.next
```



## LL CYCLE

Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.
There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.
Return true if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return false.

Example 1:

Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).

Example 2:

Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.

Example 3:

Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.

Constraints:

The number of the nodes in the list is in the range [0, 104].
-105 <= Node.val <= 105
pos is -1 or a valid index in the linked-list.

Follow up: Can you solve it using O(1) (i.e. constant) memory?

### solution

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None
class Solution:
    def hasCycle(self, head: ListNode) -> bool:
        slow, fast = head, head

        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
            if slow == fast:
                return True
        return False
```




## FIND THE DUPLICATE NUMBER

Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive.
There is only one repeated number in nums, return this repeated number.
You must solve the problem without modifying the array nums and uses only constant extra space.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,4,2,2]
Output: 2

Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,1,3,4,2]
Output: 3

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 105
nums.length == n + 1
1 <= nums[i] <= n
All the integers in nums appear only once except for precisely one integer which appears two or more times.

Follow up:

How can we prove that at least one duplicate number must exist in nums?
Can you solve the problem in linear runtime complexity?

### solution

```python
class Solution:
    def findDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        slow, fast = 0, 0
        while True:
            slow = nums[slow]
            fast = nums[nums[fast]]
            if slow == fast:
                break

        slow2 = 0
        while True:
            slow = nums[slow]
            slow2 = nums[slow2]
            if slow == slow2:
                return slow
```



## LRU CACHE

Design a data structure that follows the constraints of a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache.
Implement the LRUCache class:
LRUCache(int capacity) Initialize the LRU cache with positive size capacity.
int get(int key) Return the value of the key if the key exists, otherwise return -1.
void put(int key, int value) Update the value of the key if the key exists. Otherwise, add the key-value pair to the cache. If the number of keys exceeds the capacity from this operation, evict the least recently used key.
The functions get and put must each run in O(1) average time complexity.

Example 1:

Input
["LRUCache", "put", "put", "get", "put", "get", "put", "get", "get", "get"]
[[2], [1, 1], [2, 2], [1], [3, 3], [2], [4, 4], [1], [3], [4]]
Output
[null, null, null, 1, null, -1, null, -1, 3, 4]

Explanation
LRUCache lRUCache = new LRUCache(2);
lRUCache.put(1, 1); // cache is {1=1}
lRUCache.put(2, 2); // cache is {1=1, 2=2}
lRUCache.get(1);    // return 1
lRUCache.put(3, 3); // LRU key was 2, evicts key 2, cache is {1=1, 3=3}
lRUCache.get(2);    // returns -1 (not found)
lRUCache.put(4, 4); // LRU key was 1, evicts key 1, cache is {4=4, 3=3}
lRUCache.get(1);    // return -1 (not found)
lRUCache.get(3);    // return 3
lRUCache.get(4);    // return 4

Constraints:

1 <= capacity <= 3000
0 <= key <= 104
0 <= value <= 105
At most 2 * 105 calls will be made to get and put.

### solution

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, key, val):
        self.key, self.val = key, val
        self.prev = self.next = None


class LRUCache:
    def __init__(self, capacity: int):
        self.cap = capacity
        self.cache = {}  # map key to node

        self.left, self.right = Node(0, 0), Node(0, 0)
        self.left.next, self.right.prev = self.right, self.left

    # remove node from list
    def remove(self, node):
        prev, nxt = node.prev, node.next
        prev.next, nxt.prev = nxt, prev

    # insert node at right
    def insert(self, node):
        prev, nxt = self.right.prev, self.right
        prev.next = nxt.prev = node
        node.next, node.prev = nxt, prev

    def get(self, key: int) -> int:
        if key in self.cache:
            self.remove(self.cache[key])
            self.insert(self.cache[key])
            return self.cache[key].val
        return -1

    def put(self, key: int, value: int) -> None:
        if key in self.cache:
            self.remove(self.cache[key])
        self.cache[key] = Node(key, value)
        self.insert(self.cache[key])

        if len(self.cache) > self.cap:
            # remove from the list and delete the LRU from hashmap
            lru = self.left.next
            self.remove(lru)
            del self.cache[lru.key]
```



## MERGE K SORTED LISTS

You are given an array of k linked-lists lists, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order.
Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.

Example 1:

Input: lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]
Explanation: The linked-lists are:
[
  1->4->5,
  1->3->4,
  2->6
]
merging them into one sorted list:
1->1->2->3->4->4->5->6

Example 2:

Input: lists = []
Output: []

Example 3:

Input: lists = [[]]
Output: []

Constraints:

k == lists.length
0 <= k <= 104
0 <= lists[i].length <= 500
-104 <= lists[i][j] <= 104
lists[i] is sorted in ascending order.
The sum of lists[i].length will not exceed 104.

### solution

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def mergeKLists(self, lists: List[ListNode]) -> ListNode:
        if not lists or len(lists) == 0:
            return None

        while len(lists) > 1:
            mergedLists = []
            for i in range(0, len(lists), 2):
                l1 = lists[i]
                l2 = lists[i + 1] if (i + 1) < len(lists) else None
                mergedLists.append(self.mergeList(l1, l2))
            lists = mergedLists
        return lists[0]

    def mergeList(self, l1, l2):
        dummy = ListNode()
        tail = dummy

        while l1 and l2:
            if l1.val < l2.val:
                tail.next = l1
                l1 = l1.next
            else:

```



## REVERSE NODES IN K-GROUP

Given the head of a linked list, reverse the nodes of the list k at a time, and return the modified list.
k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes, in the end, should remain as it is.
You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes themselves may be changed.

Example 1:

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Output: [2,1,4,3,5]

Example 2:

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 3
Output: [3,2,1,4,5]

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is n.
1 <= k <= n <= 5000
0 <= Node.val <= 1000

Follow-up: Can you solve the problem in O(1) extra memory space?

### solution

```python
class Solution:
    def reverseKGroup(self, head: ListNode, k: int) -> ListNode:
        dummy = ListNode(0, head)
        groupPrev = dummy

        while True:
            kth = self.getKth(groupPrev, k)
            if not kth:
                break
            groupNext = kth.next

            # reverse group
            prev, curr = kth.next, groupPrev.next
            while curr != groupNext:
                tmp = curr.next
                curr.next = prev
                prev = curr
                curr = tmp

            tmp = groupPrev.next
            groupPrev.next = kth
            groupPrev = tmp
        return dummy.next

    def getKth(self, curr, k):
        while curr and k > 0:
            curr = curr.next
            k -= 1
        return curr
```
