Given the root of a binary tree, invert the tree, and return its root.

Example 1:

Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3,6,9]
Output: [4,7,2,9,6,3,1]

Example 2:

Input: root = [2,1,3]

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100

### solution

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def invertTree(self, root: TreeNode) -> TreeNode:
        if not root:
            return None

        # swap the children
        tmp = root.left
        root.left = root.right

        self.invertTree(root.right)
        return root
```

Example 2:

Input: root = [1,null,2]
Output: 2

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 104].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100

### solution

```python
# RECURSIVE DFS
class Solution:
    def maxDepth(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        if not root:
            return 0

        return 1 + max(self.maxDepth(root.left), self.maxDepth(root.right))


# ITERATIVE DFS
class Solution:
    def maxDepth(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        stack = [[root, 1]]
        res = 0

        while stack:

            level += 1
        return level
```



## DIAMETER OF A BT

Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.
The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.
The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

Example 1:

Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: 3 is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].

Example 2:

Input: root = [1,2]
Output: 1

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100

### solution

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def diameterOfBinaryTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        res = 0

        def dfs(root):
            nonlocal res

            if not root:
                return 0
            left = dfs(root.left)
            right = dfs(root.right)
            res = max(res, left + right)

            return 1 + max(left, right)

        dfs(root)
        return res
```

Given a binary tree, determine if it is
height-balanced.

Example 1:

Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: true

Example 2:

Input: root = [1,2,2,3,3,null,null,4,4]
Output: false

Example 3:

Input: root = []
Output: true

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 5000].
-104 <= Node.val <= 104

#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def isBalanced(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        def dfs(root):
            if not root:
                return [True, 0]

            left, right = dfs(root.left), dfs(root.right)
            balanced = left[0] and right[0] and abs(left[1] - right[1]) <= 1
            return [balanced, 1 + max(left[1], right[1])]

        return dfs(root)[0]
```



## SAME TREE

Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.
Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

Example 1:

Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]
Output: true

Example 2:

Input: p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]
Output: false

Example 3:

Input: p = [1,2,1], q = [1,1,2]
Output: false

Constraints:

The number of nodes in both trees is in the range [0, 100].
-104 <= Node.val <= 104

### solution

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None


class Solution:
    def isSameTree(self, p: TreeNode, q: TreeNode) -> bool:
        if not p and not q:
            return True
        if p and q and p.val == q.val:
            return self.isSameTree(p.left, q.left) and self.isSameTree(p.right, q.right)
        else:
            return False
```



## SUBTREE OF ANOTHER TREE

Given the roots of two binary trees root and subRoot, return true if there is a subtree of root with the same structure and node values of subRoot and false otherwise.
A subtree of a binary tree tree is a tree that consists of a node in tree and all of this node's descendants. The tree tree could also be considered as a subtree of itself.

Example 1:

Input: root = [3,4,5,1,2], subRoot = [4,1,2]
Output: true

Example 2:

Input: root = [3,4,5,1,2,null,null,null,null,0], subRoot = [4,1,2]
Output: false

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the root tree is in the range [1, 2000].
The number of nodes in the subRoot tree is in the range [1, 1000].
-104 <= root.val <= 104
-104 <= subRoot.val <= 104

### solution

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def isSubtree(self, s: TreeNode, t: TreeNode) -> bool:
        if not t:
            return True
        if not s:
            return False

        if self.sameTree(s, t):
            return True
        return self.isSubtree(s.left, t) or self.isSubtree(s.right, t)

    def sameTree(self, s, t):
        if not s and not t:
            return True
        if s and t and s.val == t.val:
            return self.sameTree(s.left, t.left) and self.sameTree(s.right, t.right)
        return False
```



## LOWEST COMMON ANCHESTOR OF A BST

Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST.
According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

Example 1:

Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
Output: 6
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.

Example 2:

Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

Example 3:

Input: root = [2,1], p = 2, q = 1
Output: 2

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 105].
-109 <= Node.val <= 109
All Node.val are unique.
p != q
p and q will exist in the BST.

#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None


class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(
        self, root: "TreeNode", p: "TreeNode", q: "TreeNode"
    ) -> "TreeNode":
        cur = root
        while cur:
            if p.val > cur.val and q.val > cur.val:
                cur = cur.right
            elif p.val < cur.val and q.val < cur.val:
                cur = cur.left
            else:
                return cur
```



## BT LEVEL ORDER TRAVERSAL

Given the root of a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, level by level).

Example 1:

Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [[3],[9,20],[15,7]]

Example 2:

Input: root = [1]
Output: [[1]]

Example 3:

Input: root = []
Output: []

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 2000].
-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000

### solution

```python

#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None

class Solution:
    def levelOrder(self, root: TreeNode) -> List[List[int]]:
        res = []
        q = collections.deque()
        if root:
            q.append(root)

        while q:
            val = []

            for i in range(len(q)):
                node = q.popleft()
                val.append(node.val)
                if node.left:
                    q.append(node.left)
                if node.right:

            res.append(val)
        return res
```

#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left

class Solution:
    def rightSideView(self, root: TreeNode) -> List[int]:
        res = []
        q = collections.deque([root])

        while q:
            rightSide = None
            qLen = len(q)

```



## COUNT GOOD NODES IN BT

Given a binary tree root, a node X in the tree is named good if in the path from root to X there are no nodes with a value greater than X.
Return the number of good nodes in the binary tree.

Example 1:

Input: root = [3,1,4,3,null,1,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Nodes in blue are good.
Root Node (3) is always a good node.
Node 4 -> (3,4) is the maximum value in the path starting from the root.
Node 5 -> (3,4,5) is the maximum value in the path
Node 3 -> (3,1,3) is the maximum value in the path.

Example 2:

Input: root = [3,3,null,4,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: Node 2 -> (3, 3, 2) is not good, because "3" is higher than it.

Example 3:

Input: root = [1]
Output: 1
Explanation: Root is considered as good.

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the binary tree is in the range [1, 10^5].
Each node's value is between [-10^4, 10^4].

### solution

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:

        def dfs(node, maxVal):
            if not node:
                return 0

            res = 1 if node.val >= maxVal else 0
            maxVal = max(maxVal, node.val)

            res += dfs(node.right, maxVal)
            return res

        return dfs(root, root.val)
```



## VALIDATE BST

Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

A valid BST is defined as follows:

The left
subtree
 of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

Example 1:

Input: root = [2,1,3]
Output: true

Example 2:

Input: root = [5,1,4,null,null,3,6]
Output: false
Explanation: The root node's value is 5 but its right child's value is 4.

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].
-231 <= Node.val <= 231 - 1

### solution

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def isValidBST(self, root: TreeNode) -> bool:
        def valid(node, left, right):
            if not node:
                return True
            if not (node.val < right and node.val > left):
                return False

            return valid(node.left, left, node.val) and valid(
                node.right, node.val, right
            )

        return valid(root, float("-inf"), float("inf"))
```



## KTH SMALLEST ELEMENT IN BST

Given the root of a binary search tree, and an integer k, return the kth smallest value (1-indexed) of all the values of the nodes in the tree.

Example 1:

Input: root = [3,1,4,null,2], k = 1
Output: 1

Example 2:

Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], k = 3
Output: 3

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is n.
1 <= k <= n <= 104
0 <= Node.val <= 104


Follow up: If the BST is modified often (i.e., we can do insert and delete operations) and you need to find the kth smallest frequently, how would you optimize?

### solution

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None


class Solution:
    def kthSmallest(self, root: TreeNode, k: int) -> int:
        stack = []
        curr = root

        while stack or curr:
            while curr:
                stack.append(curr)
                curr = curr.left
            curr = stack.pop()
            k -= 1
            if k == 0:
                return curr.val
            curr = curr.right
```



## CONSTRUCT BT FROM PREORDER AND INORDER TRAVERSAL

Given two integer arrays preorder and inorder where preorder is the preorder traversal of a binary tree and inorder is the inorder traversal of the same tree, construct and return the binary tree.

Example 1:

Input: preorder = [3,9,20,15,7], inorder = [9,3,15,20,7]
Output: [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]

Example 2:

Input: preorder = [-1], inorder = [-1]
Output: [-1]

Constraints:

1 <= preorder.length <= 3000
inorder.length == preorder.length
-3000 <= preorder[i], inorder[i] <= 3000
preorder and inorder consist of unique values.
Each value of inorder also appears in preorder.
preorder is guaranteed to be the preorder traversal of the tree.
inorder is guaranteed to be the inorder traversal of the tree.

### solution

```python
class Solution:
    def buildTree(self, preorder: List[int], inorder: List[int]) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        if not preorder or not inorder:
            return None

        root = TreeNode(preorder[0])
        mid = inorder.index(preorder[0])
        root.left = self.buildTree(preorder[1 : mid + 1], inorder[:mid])
        root.right = self.buildTree(preorder[mid + 1 :], inorder[mid + 1 :])
        return root
```



## BT MAX PATH SUM

A path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence at most once. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.
The path sum of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.
Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum path sum of any non-empty path.

Example 1:

Input: root = [1,2,3]
Output: 6
Explanation: The optimal path is 2 -> 1 -> 3 with a path sum of 2 + 1 + 3 = 6.

Example 2:

Input: root = [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 42
Explanation: The optimal path is 15 -> 20 -> 7 with a path sum of 15 + 20 + 7 = 42.

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 3 * 104].
-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000

## SERIALIZE AND DESERIALIZE BT

Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.
Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.
Clarification: The input/output format is the same as how LeetCode serializes a binary tree. You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.

Example 1:

Input: root = [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]
Output: [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]

Example 2:

Input: root = []
Output: []

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 104].
-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000

### solution

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None


class Codec:
    def serialize(self, root):
        res = []

        def dfs(node):
            if not node:
                res.append("N")
                return
            res.append(str(node.val))
            dfs(node.left)
            dfs(node.right)

        dfs(root)
        return ",".join(res)

    def deserialize(self, data):
        vals = data.split(",")
        self.i = 0

        def dfs():
            if vals[self.i] == "N":
                self.i += 1
                return None
            node = TreeNode(int(vals[self.i]))
            self.i += 1
            node.left = dfs()
            node.right = dfs()
            return node

        return dfs()
```
