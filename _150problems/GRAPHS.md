## NUMBER OF ISLANDS

Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.
An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.
 
Example 1:
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1

Example 2:
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3
 
Constraints:

m == grid.length
n == grid[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 300
grid[i][j] is '0' or '1'.

### solution

```python
class Solution:
    def numIslands(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        if not grid or not grid[0]:
            return 0

        islands = 0

                or grid[r][c] == "0"
                or (r, c) in visit
            ):
                return

                     islands +=1 

         return islands

```

## CLONE GRAPH

Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph.
Return a deep copy (clone) of the graph.
Each node in the graph contains a value (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.
class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;
}

Test case format:
For simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with val == 1, the second node with val == 2, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.
An adjacency list is a collection of unordered lists used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.
The given node will always be the first node with val = 1. You must return the copy of the given node as a reference to the cloned graph.

Example 1:
Input: adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Output: [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Explanation: There are 4 nodes in the graph.
1st node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
2nd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
3rd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
4th node (val = 4)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).

Example 2:
Input: adjList = [[]]
Output: [[]]
Explanation: Note that the input contains one empty list. The graph consists of only one node with val = 1 and it does not have any neighbors.

Example 3:
Input: adjList = []
Output: []
Explanation: This an empty graph, it does not have any nodes.
 
Constraints:

The number of nodes in the graph is in the range [0, 100].
1 <= Node.val <= 100
Node.val is unique for each node.
There are no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph.
The Graph is connected and all nodes can be visited starting from the given node.

### solution

```python
class Solution:
    def cloneGraph(self, node: "Node") -> "Node":
        oldToNew = {}

        def dfs(node):
            if node in oldToNew:
                return oldToNew[node]

            copy = Node(node.val)
            oldToNew[node] = copy
            for nei in node.neighbors:
                copy.neighbors.append(dfs(nei))
            return copy

        return dfs(node) if node else None
```

## MAX AREA OF ISLAND

You are given an m x n binary matrix grid. An island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.
The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.
Return the maximum area of an island in grid. If there is no island, return 0.

Example 1:
Input: grid = [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 6
Explanation: The answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.

Example 2:
Input: grid = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 0
 
Constraints:

m == grid.length
n == grid[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 50
grid[i][j] is either 0 or 1.

### solution

```python
class Solution:
    def maxAreaOfIsland(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        ROWS, COLS = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        visit = set()

        def dfs(r, c):
            if (
                r < 0
                or r == ROWS
                or c < 0
                or c == COLS
                or grid[r][c] == 0
                or (r, c) in visit
            ):
                return 0
            visit.add((r, c))
            return 1 + dfs(r + 1, c) + dfs(r - 1, c) + dfs(r, c + 1) + dfs(r, c - 1)

        area = 0
        for r in range(ROWS):
            for c in range(COLS):
                area = max(area, dfs(r, c))
        return area
```

## PACIFIC ATLANTIC WATER FLOW

There is an m x n rectangular island that borders both the Pacific Ocean and Atlantic Ocean. The Pacific Ocean touches the island's left and top edges, and the Atlantic Ocean touches the island's right and bottom edges.
The island is partitioned into a grid of square cells. You are given an m x n integer matrix heights where heights[r][c] represents the height above sea level of the cell at coordinate (r, c).
The island receives a lot of rain, and the rain water can flow to neighboring cells directly north, south, east, and west if the neighboring cell's height is less than or equal to the current cell's height. Water can flow from any cell adjacent to an ocean into the ocean.
Return a 2D list of grid coordinates result where result[i] = [ri, ci] denotes that rain water can flow from cell (ri, ci) to both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.

Example 1:
Input: heights = [[1,2,2,3,5],[3,2,3,4,4],[2,4,5,3,1],[6,7,1,4,5],[5,1,1,2,4]]
Output: [[0,4],[1,3],[1,4],[2,2],[3,0],[3,1],[4,0]]
Explanation: The following cells can flow to the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, as shown below:
[0,4]: [0,4] -> Pacific Ocean 
       [0,4] -> Atlantic Ocean
[1,3]: [1,3] -> [0,3] -> Pacific Ocean 
       [1,3] -> [1,4] -> Atlantic Ocean
[1,4]: [1,4] -> [1,3] -> [0,3] -> Pacific Ocean 
       [1,4] -> Atlantic Ocean
[2,2]: [2,2] -> [1,2] -> [0,2] -> Pacific Ocean 
       [2,2] -> [2,3] -> [2,4] -> Atlantic Ocean
[3,0]: [3,0] -> Pacific Ocean 
       [3,0] -> [4,0] -> Atlantic Ocean
[3,1]: [3,1] -> [3,0] -> Pacific Ocean 
       [3,1] -> [4,1] -> Atlantic Ocean
[4,0]: [4,0] -> Pacific Ocean 
       [4,0] -> Atlantic Ocean
Note that there are other possible paths for these cells to flow to the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.

Example 2:
Input: heights = [[1]]
Output: [[0,0]]
Explanation: The water can flow from the only cell to the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.
 
Constraints:

m == heights.length
n == heights[r].length
1 <= m, n <= 200
0 <= heights[r][c] <= 105

### solution

```python
class Solution:
    def pacificAtlantic(self, heights: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        ROWS, COLS = len(heights), len(heights[0])
        pac, atl = set(), set()

        def dfs(r, c, visit, prevHeight):
            if (
                (r, c) in visit
                or r < 0
                or c < 0
                or r == ROWS
                or c == COLS
                or heights[r][c] < prevHeight
            ):
                return
            visit.add((r, c))
            dfs(r + 1, c, visit, heights[r][c])
            dfs(r - 1, c, visit, heights[r][c])
            dfs(r, c + 1, visit, heights[r][c])
            dfs(r, c - 1, visit, heights[r][c])

        for c in range(COLS):
            dfs(0, c, pac, heights[0][c])
            dfs(ROWS - 1, c, atl, heights[ROWS - 1][c])

        for r in range(ROWS):
            dfs(r, 0, pac, heights[r][0])
            dfs(r, COLS - 1, atl, heights[r][COLS - 1])

        res = []
        for r in range(ROWS):
            for c in range(COLS):
                if (r, c) in pac and (r, c) in atl:
                    res.append([r, c])
        return res
```

## SURROUNDED REGIONS

Given an m x n matrix board containing 'X' and 'O', capture all regions that are 4-directionally surrounded by 'X'.
A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.

Example 1:
Input: board = [["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","O","X"],["X","X","O","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
Output: [["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
Explanation: Notice that an 'O' should not be flipped if:
- It is on the border, or
- It is adjacent to an 'O' that should not be flipped.
The bottom 'O' is on the border, so it is not flipped.
The other three 'O' form a surrounded region, so they are flipped.

Example 2:
Input: board = [["X"]]
Output: [["X"]]

Constraints:

m == board.length
n == board[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 200
board[i][j] is 'X' or 'O'.

### solution

```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, board: List[List[str]]) -> None:
        ROWS, COLS = len(board), len(board[0])

        def capture(r, c):
            if r < 0 or c < 0 or r == ROWS or c == COLS or board[r][c] != "O":
                return
            board[r][c] = "T"
            capture(r + 1, c)
            capture(r - 1, c)
            capture(r, c + 1)
            capture(r, c - 1)

        # 1. (DFS) Capture unsurrounded regions (O -> T)
        for r in range(ROWS):
            for c in range(COLS):
                if board[r][c] == "O" and (r in [0, ROWS - 1] or c in [0, COLS - 1]):
                    capture(r, c)

        # 2. Capture surrounded regions (O -> X)
        for r in range(ROWS):
            for c in range(COLS):
                if board[r][c] == "O":
                    board[r][c] = "X"

        # 3. Uncapture unsurrounded regions (T -> O)
        for r in range(ROWS):
            for c in range(COLS):
                if board[r][c] == "T":
                    board[r][c] = "O"
```

## ROTTING ORANGES

You are given an m x n grid where each cell can have one of three values:
0 representing an empty cell,
1 representing a fresh orange, or
2 representing a rotten orange.
Every minute, any fresh orange that is 4-directionally adjacent to a rotten orange becomes rotten.
Return the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange. If this is impossible, return -1.

Example 1:

Input: grid = [[2,1,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]]
Output: 4

Example 2:
Input: grid = [[2,1,1],[0,1,1],[1,0,1]]
Output: -1
Explanation: The orange in the bottom left corner (row 2, column 0) is never rotten, because rotting only happens 4-directionally.

Example 3:
Input: grid = [[0,2]]
Output: 0
Explanation: Since there are already no fresh oranges at minute 0, the answer is just 0.
 
Constraints:

m == grid.length
n == grid[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 10
grid[i][j] is 0, 1, or 2.

### solution

```python
class Solution:
    def orangesRotting(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        q = collections.deque()
        fresh = 0
        time = 0

        for r in range(len(grid)):
            for c in range(len(grid[0])):
                if grid[r][c] == 1:
                    fresh += 1
                if grid[r][c] == 2:
                    q.append((r, c))

        directions = [[0, 1], [0, -1], [1, 0], [-1, 0]]
        while fresh > 0 and q:
            length = len(q)
            for i in range(length):
                r, c = q.popleft()

                for dr, dc in directions:
                    row, col = r + dr, c + dc
                    # if in bounds and nonrotten, make rotten
                    # and add to q
                    if (
                        row in range(len(grid))
                        and col in range(len(grid[0]))
                        and grid[row][col] == 1
                    ):
                        grid[row][col] = 2
                        q.append((row, col))
                        fresh -= 1
            time += 1
        return time if fresh == 0 else -1
```

## WALLS OF GATES

You are given a m x n 2D grid initialized with these three possible values.
-1 - A wall or an obstacle.
0 - A gate.
INF - Infinity means an empty room. We use the value 2^31 - 1 = 2147483647 to represent INF as you may assume that the distance to a gate is less than 2147483647.
Fill each empty room with the distance to its nearest gate. If it is impossible to reach a Gate, that room should remain filled with INF

## COURSE SCHEDULE

There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1. You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you must take course bi first if you want to take course ai.
For example, the pair [0, 1], indicates that to take course 0 you have to first take course 1.
Return true if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return false.

Example 1:
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.

Example 2:
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
 
Constraints:

1 <= numCourses <= 2000
0 <= prerequisites.length <= 5000
prerequisites[i].length == 2
0 <= ai, bi < numCourses
All the pairs prerequisites[i] are unique.

### solution

```python
class Solution:
    def canFinish(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        # dfs
        preMap = {i: [] for i in range(numCourses)}

        # map each course to : prereq list
        for crs, pre in prerequisites:
            preMap[crs].append(pre)

        visiting = set()

        def dfs(crs):
            if crs in visiting:
                return False
            if preMap[crs] == []:
                return True

            visiting.add(crs)
            for pre in preMap[crs]:
                if not dfs(pre):
                    return False
            visiting.remove(crs)
            preMap[crs] = []
            return True

        for c in range(numCourses):
            if not dfs(c):
                return False
        return True
```

## COURSE SCHEDULE II

There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1. You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you must take course bi first if you want to take course ai.

For example, the pair [0, 1], indicates that to take course 0 you have to first take course 1.
Return the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses. If there are many valid answers, return any of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses, return an empty array.

Example 1:
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So the correct course order is [0,1].

Example 2:
Input: numCourses = 4, prerequisites = [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]
Output: [0,2,1,3]
Explanation: There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take course 3 you should have finished both courses 1 and 2. Both courses 1 and 2 should be taken after you finished course 0.
So one correct course order is [0,1,2,3]. Another correct ordering is [0,2,1,3].

Example 3:
Input: numCourses = 1, prerequisites = []
Output: [0]
 
Constraints:

1 <= numCourses <= 2000
0 <= prerequisites.length <= numCourses * (numCourses - 1)
prerequisites[i].length == 2
0 <= ai, bi < numCourses
ai != bi
All the pairs [ai, bi] are distinct.

## solution
```python
class Solution:
    def findOrder(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        prereq = {c: [] for c in range(numCourses)}
        for crs, pre in prerequisites:
            prereq[crs].append(pre)

        output = []
        visit, cycle = set(), set()

        def dfs(crs):
            if crs in cycle:
                return False
            if crs in visit:
                return True

            cycle.add(crs)
            for pre in prereq[crs]:
                if dfs(pre) == False:
                    return False
            cycle.remove(crs)
            visit.add(crs)
            output.append(crs)
            return True

        for c in range(numCourses):
            if dfs(c) == False:
                return []
        return output
```

## REDUNDANT CONNECTION

In this problem, a tree is an undirected graph that is connected and has no cycles.
You are given a graph that started as a tree with n nodes labeled from 1 to n, with one additional edge added. The added edge has two different vertices chosen from 1 to n, and was not an edge that already existed. The graph is represented as an array edges of length n where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the graph.
Return an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a tree of n nodes. If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the input.

Example 1:
Input: edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: [2,3]

Example 2:
Input: edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,4],[1,5]]
Output: [1,4]

Constraints:

n == edges.length
3 <= n <= 1000
edges[i].length == 2
1 <= ai < bi <= edges.length
ai != bi
There are no repeated edges.
The given graph is connected.

### solution
```python
class Solution:
    def findRedundantConnection(self, edges: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        par = [i for i in range(len(edges) + 1)]
        rank = [1] * (len(edges) + 1)

        def find(n):
            p = par[n]
            while p != par[p]:
                par[p] = par[par[p]]
                p = par[p]
            return p

        # return False if already unioned
        def union(n1, n2):
            p1, p2 = find(n1), find(n2)

            if p1 == p2:
                return False
            if rank[p1] > rank[p2]:
                par[p2] = p1
                rank[p1] += rank[p2]
            else:
                par[p1] = p2
                rank[p2] += rank[p1]
            return True

        for n1, n2 in edges:
            if not union(n1, n2):
                return [n1, n2]
```

## NUMBER OF CONNECTED COMPONENTS IN AN UNDIRECTED GRAPH

In this problem, there is an undirected graph with n nodes. There is also an edges array. Where edges[i] = [a, b] means that there is an edge between node a and node b in the graph.
You need to return the number of connected components in that graph.

You can assume that no duplicate edges will appear in edges. Since all edges are undirected, [0, 1] is the same as [1, 0] and thus will not appear together in edges.

Example 1:
Input: n = 5 edges = [[0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 3], [1, 4]]
Output: true.

Example 2:
Input: n = 5 edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [1, 3], [1, 4]]
Output: false.

### solution

```python
class Solution:
    """
    @param n: An integer
    @param edges: a list of undirected edges
    @return: true if it's a valid tree, or false
    """
    def validTree(self, n, edges):
        if n - 1 != len(edges):
            return False
        
        self.father = {i: i for i in range(n)}
        self.size = n
        
        for a, b in edges:
            self.union(a, b)
            
        return self.size == 1
        
    def union(self, a, b):
        root_a = self.find(a)
        root_b = self.find(b)
        if root_a != root_b:
            self.size -= 1
            self.father[root_a] = root_b
        
    def find(self, node):

## WORD LADDER

A transformation sequence from word beginWord to word endWord using a dictionary wordList is a sequence of words beginWord -> s1 -> s2 -> ... -> sk such that:
Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.
Every si for 1 <= i <= k is in wordList. Note that beginWord does not need to be in wordList.
sk == endWord
Given two words, beginWord and endWord, and a dictionary wordList, return the number of words in the shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord, or 0 if no such sequence exists.

Example 1:
Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
Output: 5
Explanation: One shortest transformation sequence is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> cog", which is 5 words long.

Example 2:
Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
Output: 0
Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore there is no valid transformation sequence.
 
Constraints:

1 <= beginWord.length <= 10
endWord.length == beginWord.length
1 <= wordList.length <= 5000
wordList[i].length == beginWord.length
beginWord, endWord, and wordList[i] consist of lowercase English letters.
beginWord != endWord
All the words in wordList are unique.

### solution
```python
class Solution:
    def ladderLength(self, beginWord: str, endWord: str, wordList: List[str]) -> int:
        if endWord not in wordList:
            return 0

        nei = collections.defaultdict(list)
        wordList.append(beginWord)
        for word in wordList:
            for j in range(len(word)):
                pattern = word[:j] + "*" + word[j + 1 :]
                nei[pattern].append(word)

        visit = set([beginWord])
        q = deque([beginWord])
        res = 1
        while q:
            for i in range(len(q)):
                word = q.popleft()
                if word == endWord:
                    return res
                for j in range(len(word)):
                    pattern = word[:j] + "*" + word[j + 1 :]
                    for neiWord in nei[pattern]:
                        if neiWord not in visit:
                            visit.add(neiWord)
                            q.append(neiWord)
            res += 1
        return 0
```
