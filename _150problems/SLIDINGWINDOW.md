## BEST TIME TO BUT AND SELL STOCK

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.
Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

Example 1:

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

Example 2:

Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.

Constraints:

1 <= prices.length <= 105
0 <= prices[i] <= 104

### solution

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        res = 0

        l = 0
        for r in range(1, len(prices)):
            if prices[r] < prices[l]:
                l = r
            res = max(res, prices[r] - prices[l])
        return res
```


## LONGEST SUBSTRING WITHOUT REPETITIONS

Given a string s, find the length of the longest
substring
 without repeating characters.

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

Example 2:

Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

Example 3:

Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

Constraints:

0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.

### solution

```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        charSet = set()
        l = 0
        res = 0

        for r in range(len(s)):
            while s[r] in charSet:
                charSet.remove(s[l])
                l += 1
            charSet.add(s[r])
            res = max(res, r - l + 1)
        return res
```


## LONGEST REPEATING CHAR REPLACEMENT

You are given a string s and an integer k. You can choose any character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character. You can perform this operation at most k times.
Return the length of the longest substring containing the same letter you can get after performing the above operations.

Example 1:

Input: s = "ABAB", k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: Replace the two 'A's with two 'B's or vice versa.

Example 2:

Input: s = "AABABBA", k = 1
Output: 4
Explanation: Replace the one 'A' in the middle with 'B' and form "AABBBBA".
The substring "BBBB" has the longest repeating letters, which is 4.

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 105
s consists of only uppercase English letters.
0 <= k <= s.length

### solution

```python
class Solution:
    def characterReplacement(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        count = {}
        res = 0

        l = 0
        maxf = 0
        for r in range(len(s)):
            count[s[r]] = 1 + count.get(s[r], 0)
            maxf = max(maxf, count[s[r]])

            if (r - l + 1) - maxf > k:
                count[s[l]] -= 1
                l += 1

            res = max(res, r - l + 1)
        return res
```


## PERMUTATION IN STRING

Given two strings s1 and s2, return true if s2 contains a permutation of s1, or false otherwise.
In other words, return true if one of s1's permutations is the substring of s2.

Example 1:

Input: s1 = "ab", s2 = "eidbaooo"
Output: true
Explanation: s2 contains one permutation of s1 ("ba").

Example 2:

Input: s1 = "ab", s2 = "eidboaoo"
Output: false

Constraints:

1 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 104
s1 and s2 consist of lowercase English letters.

### solution

```python
class Solution:
    def checkInclusion(self, s1: str, s2: str) -> bool:
        if len(s1) > len(s2):
            return False

        s1Count, s2Count = [0] * 26, [0] * 26
        for i in range(len(s1)):
            s1Count[ord(s1[i]) - ord("a")] += 1
            s2Count[ord(s2[i]) - ord("a")] += 1

        matches = 0
        for i in range(26):
            matches += 1 if s1Count[i] == s2Count[i] else 0

        l = 0
        for r in range(len(s1), len(s2)):
            if matches == 26:
                return True

            index = ord(s2[r]) - ord("a")
            s2Count[index] += 1
            if s1Count[index] == s2Count[index]:
                matches += 1
            elif s1Count[index] + 1 == s2Count[index]:
                matches -= 1

            index = ord(s2[l]) - ord("a")
            s2Count[index] -= 1
            if s1Count[index] == s2Count[index]:
                matches += 1
            elif s1Count[index] - 1 == s2Count[index]:
                matches -= 1
            l += 1
        return matches == 26
```


## MINIMUM WINDOW SUBSTRING

Given two strings s and t of lengths m and n respectively, return the minimum window
substring of s such that every character in t (including duplicates) is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return the empty string "".
The testcases will be generated such that the answer is unique.

Example 1:

Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"
Explanation: The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.

Example 2:

Input: s = "a", t = "a"
Output: "a"
Explanation: The entire string s is the minimum window.

Example 3:

Input: s = "a", t = "aa"
Output: ""
Explanation: Both 'a's from t must be included in the window.
Since the largest window of s only has one 'a', return empty string.

Constraints:

m == s.length
n == t.length
1 <= m, n <= 105
s and t consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters.

### solution

```python
class Solution:
    def minWindow(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        if t == "":
            return ""

        countT, window = {}, {}
        for c in t:
            countT[c] = 1 + countT.get(c, 0)

        have, need = 0, len(countT)
        res, resLen = [-1, -1], float("infinity")
        l = 0
        for r in range(len(s)):
            c = s[r]
            window[c] = 1 + window.get(c, 0)

            if c in countT and window[c] == countT[c]:
                have += 1

            while have == need:
                # update our result
                if (r - l + 1) < resLen:
                    res = [l, r]
                    resLen = r - l + 1
                # pop from the left of our window
                window[s[l]] -= 1
                if s[l] in countT and window[s[l]] < countT[s[l]]:
                    have -= 1
                l += 1
        l, r = res
        return s[l : r + 1] if resLen != float("infinity") else ""
```


## SLIDING WINDOW MAXIMUM

You are given an array of integers nums, there is a sliding window of size k which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the k numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position.
Return the max sliding window.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], k = 3
Output: [3,3,5,5,6,7]
Explanation:
Window position                Max
---------------               -----
[1  3  -1] -3  5  3  6  7       3
 1 [3  -1  -3] 5  3  6  7       3
 1  3 [-1  -3  5] 3  6  7       5
 1  3  -1 [-3  5  3] 6  7       5
 1  3  -1  -3 [5  3  6] 7       6
 1  3  -1  -3  5 [3  6  7]      7

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1], k = 1
Output: [1]

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
1 <= k <= nums.length

### solution

```python
class Solution:
    def maxSlidingWindow(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        output = []
        q = collections.deque()  # index
        l = r = 0
        # O(n) O(n)
        while r < len(nums):
            # pop smaller values from q
            while q and nums[q[-1]] < nums[r]:
                q.pop()
            q.append(r)

            # remove left val from window
            if l > q[0]:
                q.popleft()

            if (r + 1) >= k:
                output.append(nums[q[0]])
                l += 1
            r += 1

        return output
```
