## CONTAINS DUPLICATE

Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: true

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: false

Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,1,1,3,3,4,3,2,4,2]
Output: true


Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109

### solution

```python
class Solution:
    def containsDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        hashset = set()

        for n in nums:
            if n in hashset:
                return True
            hashset.add(n)
        return False
```


## VALID ANAGRAM

Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.
An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

Example 1:

Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true

Example 2:

Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false

Constraints:

1 <= s.length, t.length <= 5 * 104
s and t consist of lowercase English letters.

Follow up: What if the inputs contain Unicode characters? How would you adapt your solution to such a case?

### solution

```python
class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        if len(s) != len(t):
            return False

        countS, countT = {}, {}

        for i in range(len(s)):
            countS[s[i]] = 1 + countS.get(s[i], 0)
            countT[t[i]] = 1 + countT.get(t[i], 0)
        return countS == countT
```


## TWO SUM

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]

Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]

Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 104
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
-109 <= target <= 109
Only one valid answer exists.

Follow-up: Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than O(n2) time complexity?

### solution

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        prevMap = {}  # val -> index

        for i, n in enumerate(nums):
            diff = target - n
            if diff in prevMap:
                return [prevMap[diff], i]
            prevMap[n] = i
```



## GROUP ANAGRAMS

Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.
An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

Example 1:

Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]

Example 2:

Input: strs = [""]
Output: [[""]]

Example 3:

Input: strs = ["a"]
Output: [["a"]]

Constraints:

1 <= strs.length <= 104
0 <= strs[i].length <= 100
strs[i] consists of lowercase English letters.

### solution

```python
class Solution:
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
        ans = collections.defaultdict(list)

        for s in strs:
            count = [0] * 26
            for c in s:
                count[ord(c) - ord("a")] += 1
            ans[tuple(count)].append(s)
        return ans.values()
```



## TOP K FREQUENT ELEMENT

Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the k most frequent elements. You may return the answer in any order.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2
Output: [1,2]

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1], k = 1
Output: [1]

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
k is in the range [1, the number of unique elements in the array].
It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.

Follow up: Your algorithm's time complexity must be better than O(n log n), where n is the array's size.

### solution

```python
class Solution:
    def topKFrequent(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        count = {}
        freq = [[] for i in range(len(nums) + 1)]

        for n in nums:
            count[n] = 1 + count.get(n, 0)
        for n, c in count.items():
            freq[c].append(n)

        res = []
        for i in range(len(freq) - 1, 0, -1):
            for n in freq[i]:
                res.append(n)
                if len(res) == k:
                    return res

        # O(n)
```



## PRODUCT OF ARRAY EXCEPT SELF

Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].
The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]

Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]
Output: [0,0,9,0,0]

Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 105
-30 <= nums[i] <= 30
The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

Follow up: Can you solve the problem in O(1) extra space complexity? (The output array does not count as extra space for space complexity analysis.)

### solution

```python
class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        res = [1] * (len(nums))

        prefix = 1
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            res[i] = prefix
            prefix *= nums[i]
        postfix = 1
        for i in range(len(nums) - 1, -1, -1):
            res[i] *= postfix
            postfix *= nums[i]
        return res
```



## VALID SUDOKU

Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:

Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Note:

A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.

Example 1:

Input: board =
[["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
Output: true

Example 2:

Input: board =
[["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
Output: false
Explanation: Same as Example 1, except with the 5 in the top left corner being modified to 8. Since there are two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is invalid.

Constraints:

board.length == 9
board[i].length == 9
board[i][j] is a digit 1-9 or '.'.

### solution

```python
class Solution:
    def isValidSudoku(self, board: List[List[str]]) -> bool:
        cols = collections.defaultdict(set)
        rows = collections.defaultdict(set)
        squares = collections.defaultdict(set)  # key = (r /3, c /3)

        for r in range(9):
            for c in range(9):
                if board[r][c] == ".":
                    continue
                if (
                    board[r][c] in rows[r]
                    or board[r][c] in cols[c]
                    or board[r][c] in squares[(r // 3, c // 3)]
                ):
                    return False
                cols[c].add(board[r][c])
                rows[r].add(board[r][c])
                squares[(r // 3, c // 3)].add(board[r][c])

        return True
```


## ENCODE AND DECODE STRING

Design an algorithm to encode a list of strings to a string. The encoded string is then sent over the network and is decoded back to the original list of strings.
Please implement encode and decode

Example1
Input: ["lint","code","love","you"]
Output: ["lint","code","love","you"]
Explanation:
One possible encode method is: "lint:;code:;love:;you"

Example2
Input: ["we", "say", ":", "yes"]
Output: ["we", "say", ":", "yes"]
Explanation:
One possible encode method is: "we:;say:;:::;yes"

### solution

```python
class Solution:
    """
    @param: strs: a list of strings
    @return: encodes a list of strings to a single string.
    """
    def encode(self, strs):
        res = []
        for str in strs:
            for char in str:
                if char == ":":
                    res.append("::")
                else:
                    res.append(char)
            res.append(":;")

        return "".join(res)

    """
    @param: str: A string
    @return: dcodes a single string to a list of strings
    """
    def decode(self, str):
        res = []
        item = []
        i = 0 
        while i < len(str) - 1 :
            if str[i] == ":":
                if str[i+1] == ";":
                    resElem = "".join(item)
                    res.append( resElem )
                    item = []
                    i+=2
                elif str[i+1] == ":":
                    item.append(str[i+1])
                    i+=2
            else:
                item.append(str[i])
                i += 1
        
        return res
```


## LONGEST CONSECUTIVE SEQUENCE

Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
Output: 9

Constraints:

0 <= nums.length <= 105
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109

### solution

```python
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        numSet = set(nums)
        longest = 0

        for n in nums:
            # check if its the start of a sequence
            if (n - 1) not in numSet:
                length = 1
                while (n + length) in numSet:
                    length += 1
                longest = max(length, longest)
        return longest
```
