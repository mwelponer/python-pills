## INSERT INTERVAL
You are given an array of non-overlapping intervals intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi] represent the start and the end of the ith interval and intervals is sorted in ascending order by starti. You are also given an interval newInterval = [start, end] that represents the start and end of another interval.
Insert newInterval into intervals such that intervals is still sorted in ascending order by starti and intervals still does not have any overlapping intervals (merge overlapping intervals if necessary).
Return intervals after the insertion.

Example 1:
Input: intervals = [[1,3],[6,9]], newInterval = [2,5]
Output: [[1,5],[6,9]]

Example 2:
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16]], newInterval = [4,8]
Output: [[1,2],[3,10],[12,16]]
Explanation: Because the new interval [4,8] overlaps with [3,5],[6,7],[8,10].

Constraints:

0 <= intervals.length <= 104
intervals[i].length == 2
0 <= starti <= endi <= 105
intervals is sorted by starti in ascending order.
newInterval.length == 2
0 <= start <= end <= 105

### solution
```python
class Solution:
    def insert(
        self, intervals: List[List[int]], newInterval: List[int]
    ) -> List[List[int]]:
        res = []

        for i in range(len(intervals)):
            if newInterval[1] < intervals[i][0]:
                res.append(newInterval)
                return res + intervals[i:]
            elif newInterval[0] > intervals[i][1]:
                res.append(intervals[i])
            else:
                newInterval = [
                    min(newInterval[0], intervals[i][0]),
                    max(newInterval[1], intervals[i][1]),
                ]
        res.append(newInterval)
        return res
```

## MERGE INTERVALS
Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], merge all overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.

Example 1:
Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap, merge them into [1,6].

Example 2:
Input: intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]
Output: [[1,5]]
Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.
 
Constraints:

1 <= intervals.length <= 104
intervals[i].length == 2
0 <= starti <= endi <= 104

### solution
```python
class Solution:
    def merge(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        intervals.sort(key=lambda pair: pair[0])
        output = [intervals[0]]

        for start, end in intervals:
            lastEnd = output[-1][1]

            if start <= lastEnd:
                # merge
                output[-1][1] = max(lastEnd, end)
            else:
                output.append([start, end])
        return output
```

## NON OVERLAPPING INTERVALS
Given an array of intervals intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], return the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

Example 1:
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
Output: 1
Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of the intervals are non-overlapping.

Example 2:
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]
Output: 2
Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

Example 3:
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3]]
Output: 0
Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.

Constraints:

1 <= intervals.length <= 105
intervals[i].length == 2
-5 * 104 <= starti < endi <= 5 * 104

### solution
```python
class Solution:
    def eraseOverlapIntervals(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        intervals.sort()
        res = 0
        prevEnd = intervals[0][1]
        for start, end in intervals[1:]:
            if start >= prevEnd:
                prevEnd = end
            else:
                res += 1
                prevEnd = min(end, prevEnd)
        return res
```

## MEETING ROOMS
Given an array of meeting time intervals consisting of start and end times [[s1,e1],[s2,e2],...] (si < ei), determine if a person could attend all meetings.
(0,8),(8,10) is not conflict at 8

Example1
Input: intervals = [(0,30),(5,10),(15,20)]
Output: false
Explanation: 
(0,30), (5,10) and (0,30),(15,20) will conflict

Example2
Input: intervals = [(5,8),(9,15)]
Output: true
Explanation: 
Two times will not conflict

### solution
```python
class Solution:
    
    def canAttendMeetings(self, intervals) -> bool:
    
        end_time = -1
        for interval in sorted(intervals, key = lambda interval: interval.start):
            if interval.start < end_time:
                return False
            end_time = interval.end 
        return True
```

## MEETING ROOMS II
Given an array of meeting time intervals consisting of start and end times [[s1,e1],[s2,e2],...] (si < ei), find the minimum number of conference rooms required.)
(0,8),(8,10) is not conflict at 8

Example1
Input: intervals = [(0,30),(5,10),(15,20)]
Output: 2
Explanation:
We need two meeting rooms
room1: (0,30)
room2: (5,10),(15,20)

Example2
Input: intervals = [(2,7)]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
Only need one meeting room

### solution
```python
"""
Definition of Interval.
class Interval(object):
    def __init__(self, start, end):
        self.start = start
        self.end = end
"""

class Solution:
    """
    @param intervals: an array of meeting time intervals
    @return: the minimum number of conference rooms required
    """
    def minMeetingRooms(self, intervals):
        points = []
        for interval in intervals:
            points.append((interval.start, 1))
            points.append((interval.end, -1))
            
        meeting_rooms = 0
        ongoing_meetings = 0
        for _, delta in sorted(points):
            ongoing_meetings += delta
            meeting_rooms = max(meeting_rooms, ongoing_meetings)
            
        return meeting_rooms
```

## MINIMUM INTERVAL TO INCLUDE EACH QUERY
You are given a 2D integer array intervals, where intervals[i] = [lefti, righti] describes the ith interval starting at lefti and ending at righti (inclusive). The size of an interval is defined as the number of integers it contains, or more formally righti - lefti + 1.
You are also given an integer array queries. The answer to the jth query is the size of the smallest interval i such that lefti <= queries[j] <= righti. If no such interval exists, the answer is -1.
Return an array containing the answers to the queries.

Example 1:
Input: intervals = [[1,4],[2,4],[3,6],[4,4]], queries = [2,3,4,5]
Output: [3,3,1,4]
Explanation: The queries are processed as follows:
- Query = 2: The interval [2,4] is the smallest interval containing 2. The answer is 4 - 2 + 1 = 3.
- Query = 3: The interval [2,4] is the smallest interval containing 3. The answer is 4 - 2 + 1 = 3.
- Query = 4: The interval [4,4] is the smallest interval containing 4. The answer is 4 - 4 + 1 = 1.
- Query = 5: The interval [3,6] is the smallest interval containing 5. The answer is 6 - 3 + 1 = 4.

Example 2:
Input: intervals = [[2,3],[2,5],[1,8],[20,25]], queries = [2,19,5,22]
Output: [2,-1,4,6]
Explanation: The queries are processed as follows:
- Query = 2: The interval [2,3] is the smallest interval containing 2. The answer is 3 - 2 + 1 = 2.
- Query = 19: None of the intervals contain 19. The answer is -1.
- Query = 5: The interval [2,5] is the smallest interval containing 5. The answer is 5 - 2 + 1 = 4.
- Query = 22: The interval [20,25] is the smallest interval containing 22. The answer is 25 - 20 + 1 = 6.
 
Constraints:

1 <= intervals.length <= 105
1 <= queries.length <= 105
intervals[i].length == 2
1 <= lefti <= righti <= 107
1 <= queries[j] <= 107

### solution

```python
class Solution:
    def minInterval(self, intervals: List[List[int]], queries: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        intervals.sort()
        minHeap = []
        res = {}
        i = 0
        for q in sorted(queries):
            while i < len(intervals) and intervals[i][0] <= q:
                l, r = intervals[i]
                heapq.heappush(minHeap, (r - l + 1, r))
                i += 1

            while minHeap and minHeap[0][1] < q:
                heapq.heappop(minHeap)
            res[q] = minHeap[0][0] if minHeap else -1
        return [res[q] for q in queries]
```
