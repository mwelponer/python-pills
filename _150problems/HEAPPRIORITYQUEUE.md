## KTH LARGEST ELEMENT IN A STREAM

Design a class to find the kth largest element in a stream. Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.
Implement KthLargest class:
KthLargest(int k, int[] nums) Initializes the object with the integer k and the stream of integers nums.
int add(int val) Appends the integer val to the stream and returns the element representing the kth largest element in the stream.

Example 1:

Input
["KthLargest", "add", "add", "add", "add", "add"]
[[3, [4, 5, 8, 2]], [3], [5], [10], [9], [4]]
Output
[null, 4, 5, 5, 8, 8]

Explanation
KthLargest kthLargest = new KthLargest(3, [4, 5, 8, 2]);
kthLargest.add(3);   // return 4
kthLargest.add(5);   // return 5
kthLargest.add(10);  // return 5
kthLargest.add(9);   // return 8
kthLargest.add(4);   // return 8

Constraints:

1 <= k <= 104
0 <= nums.length <= 104
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
-104 <= val <= 104
At most 104 calls will be made to add.
It is guaranteed that there will be at least k elements in the array when you search for the kth element.

### solution

```python
class KthLargest:
    def __init__(self, k: int, nums: List[int]):
        # minHeap w/ K largest integers
        self.minHeap, self.k = nums, k
        heapq.heapify(self.minHeap)
        while len(self.minHeap) > k:
            heapq.heappop(self.minHeap)

    def add(self, val: int) -> int:
        heapq.heappush(self.minHeap, val)
        if len(self.minHeap) > self.k:
            heapq.heappop(self.minHeap)
        return self.minHeap[0]
```



## LAST STONE WEIGHT

You are given an array of integers stones where stones[i] is the weight of the ith stone.
We are playing a game with the stones. On each turn, we choose the heaviest two stones and smash them together. Suppose the heaviest two stones have weights x and y with x <= y. The result of this smash is:
If x == y, both stones are destroyed, and
If x != y, the stone of weight x is destroyed, and the stone of weight y has new weight y - x.
At the end of the game, there is at most one stone left.
Return the weight of the last remaining stone. If there are no stones left, return 0.

Example 1:

Input: stones = [2,7,4,1,8,1]
Output: 1
Explanation:
We combine 7 and 8 to get 1 so the array converts to [2,4,1,1,1] then,
we combine 2 and 4 to get 2 so the array converts to [2,1,1,1] then,
we combine 2 and 1 to get 1 so the array converts to [1,1,1] then,
we combine 1 and 1 to get 0 so the array converts to [1] then that's the value of the last stone.

Example 2:

Input: stones = [1]
Output: 1

Constraints:

1 <= stones.length <= 30
1 <= stones[i] <= 1000

### solution

```python
class Solution:
    def lastStoneWeight(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:
        stones = [-s for s in stones]
        heapq.heapify(stones)

        while len(stones) > 1:
            first = heapq.heappop(stones)
            second = heapq.heappop(stones)
            if second > first:
                heapq.heappush(stones, first - second)

        stones.append(0)
        return abs(stones[0])
```



## K CLOSEST POINT TO ORIGIN

Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k, return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).
The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., âˆš(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2).
You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).

Example 1:

Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], k = 1
Output: [[-2,2]]
Explanation:
The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).
The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).
Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.
We only want the closest k = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just [[-2,2]].

Example 2:

Input: points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], k = 2
Output: [[3,3],[-2,4]]
Explanation: The answer [[-2,4],[3,3]] would also be accepted.

Constraints:

1 <= k <= points.length <= 104
-104 < xi, yi < 104

### solution

```python
class Solution:
    def kClosest(self, points: List[List[int]], k: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        pts = []
        for x, y in points:
            dist = (abs(x - 0) ** 2) + (abs(y - 0) ** 2)
            pts.append([dist, x, y])

        res = []
        heapq.heapify(pts)
        for i in range(k):
            dist, x, y = heapq.heappop(pts)
            res.append([x, y])
        return res
```



## KTH LARGEST ELEMENT IN AN ARRAY

Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the kth largest element in the array.
Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.
You must solve it in O(n) time complexity.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,2,1,5,6,4], k = 2
Output: 5

Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,3,1,2,4,5,5,6], k = 4
Output: 4

Constraints:

1 <= k <= nums.length <= 105
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104

### solution

```python
# Solution: Sorting
# Time Complexity:
#   - Best Case: O(n)
#   - Average Case: O(n*log(n))
#   - Worst Case:O(n*log(n))
# Extra Space Complexity: O(n)
class Solution1:
    def findKthLargest(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        nums.sort()
        return nums[len(nums) - k]


# Solution: QuickSelect
# Time Complexity:
#   - Best Case: O(n)
#   - Average Case: O(n)
#   - Worst Case: O(n^2)
# Extra Space Complexity: O(1)
class Solution2:
    def partition(self, nums: List[int], left: int, right: int) -> int:
        pivot, fill = nums[right], left

        for i in range(left, right):
            if nums[i] <= pivot:
                nums[fill], nums[i] = nums[i], nums[fill]
                fill += 1

        nums[fill], nums[right] = nums[right], nums[fill]

        return fill

    def findKthLargest(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        k = len(nums) - k
        left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1

        while left < right:
            pivot = self.partition(nums, left, right)

            if pivot < k:
                left = pivot + 1
            elif pivot > k:
                right = pivot - 1
            else:
                break

        return nums[k]
```



## TASK SCHEDULER

Given a characters array tasks, representing the tasks a CPU needs to do, where each letter represents a different task. Tasks could be done in any order. Each task is done in one unit of time. For each unit of time, the CPU could complete either one task or just be idle.
However, there is a non-negative integer n that represents the cooldown period between two same tasks (the same letter in the array), that is that there must be at least n units of time between any two same tasks.
Return the least number of units of times that the CPU will take to finish all the given tasks.

Example 1:

Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2
Output: 8
Explanation:
A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B
There is at least 2 units of time between any two same tasks.

Example 2:

Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 0
Output: 6
Explanation: On this case any permutation of size 6 would work since n = 0.
["A","A","A","B","B","B"]
["A","B","A","B","A","B"]
["B","B","B","A","A","A"]
...
And so on.

Example 3:

Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","A","A","A","B","C","D","E","F","G"], n = 2
Output: 16
Explanation:
One possible solution is
A -> B -> C -> A -> D -> E -> A -> F -> G -> A -> idle -> idle -> A -> idle -> idle -> A

Constraints:

1 <= task.length <= 104
tasks[i] is upper-case English letter.
The integer n is in the range [0, 100].

### solution

```python
class Solution:
    def leastInterval(self, tasks: List[str], n: int) -> int:
        count = Counter(tasks)
        maxHeap = [-cnt for cnt in count.values()]
        heapq.heapify(maxHeap)

        time = 0
        q = deque()  # pairs of [-cnt, idleTime]
        while maxHeap or q:
            time += 1

            if not maxHeap:
                time = q[0][1]
            else:
                cnt = 1 + heapq.heappop(maxHeap)
                if cnt:
                    q.append([cnt, time + n])
            if q and q[0][1] == time:
                heapq.heappush(maxHeap, q.popleft()[0])
        return time
```



## DESIGN TWITTER

Design a simplified version of Twitter where users can post tweets, follow/unfollow another user, and is able to see the 10 most recent tweets in the user's news feed.
Implement the Twitter class:
Twitter() Initializes your twitter object.
void postTweet(int userId, int tweetId) Composes a new tweet with ID tweetId by the user userId. Each call to this function will be made with a unique tweetId.
List<Integer> getNewsFeed(int userId) Retrieves the 10 most recent tweet IDs in the user's news feed. Each item in the news feed must be posted by users who the user followed or by the user themself. Tweets must be ordered from most recent to least recent.
void follow(int followerId, int followeeId) The user with ID followerId started following the user with ID followeeId.
void unfollow(int followerId, int followeeId) The user with ID followerId started unfollowing the user with ID followeeId.

Example 1:

Input
["Twitter", "postTweet", "getNewsFeed", "follow", "postTweet", "getNewsFeed", "unfollow", "getNewsFeed"]
[[], [1, 5], [1], [1, 2], [2, 6], [1], [1, 2], [1]]
Output
[null, null, [5], null, null, [6, 5], null, [5]]

Explanation
Twitter twitter = new Twitter();
twitter.postTweet(1, 5); // User 1 posts a new tweet (id = 5).
twitter.getNewsFeed(1);  // User 1's news feed should return a list with 1 tweet id -> [5]. return [5]
twitter.follow(1, 2);    // User 1 follows user 2.
twitter.postTweet(2, 6); // User 2 posts a new tweet (id = 6).
twitter.getNewsFeed(1);  // User 1's news feed should return a list with 2 tweet ids -> [6, 5]. Tweet id 6 should precede tweet id 5 because it is posted after tweet id 5.
twitter.unfollow(1, 2);  // User 1 unfollows user 2.
twitter.getNewsFeed(1);  // User 1's news feed should return a list with 1 tweet id -> [5], since user 1 is no longer following user 2.

Constraints:

1 <= userId, followerId, followeeId <= 500
0 <= tweetId <= 104
All the tweets have unique IDs.
At most 3 * 104 calls will be made to postTweet, getNewsFeed, follow, and unfollow.

### solution

```python
class Twitter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.count = 0
        self.tweetMap = defaultdict(list)  # userId -> list of [count, tweetIds]
        self.followMap = defaultdict(set)  # userId -> set of followeeId

    def postTweet(self, userId: int, tweetId: int) -> None:
        self.tweetMap[userId].append([self.count, tweetId])
        self.count -= 1

    def getNewsFeed(self, userId: int) -> List[int]:
        res = []
        minHeap = []

        self.followMap[userId].add(userId)
        for followeeId in self.followMap[userId]:
            if followeeId in self.tweetMap:
                index = len(self.tweetMap[followeeId]) - 1
                count, tweetId = self.tweetMap[followeeId][index]
                heapq.heappush(minHeap, [count, tweetId, followeeId, index - 1])

        while minHeap and len(res) < 10:
            count, tweetId, followeeId, index = heapq.heappop(minHeap)
            res.append(tweetId)
            if index >= 0:
                count, tweetId = self.tweetMap[followeeId][index]
                heapq.heappush(minHeap, [count, tweetId, followeeId, index - 1])
        return res

    def follow(self, followerId: int, followeeId: int) -> None:
        self.followMap[followerId].add(followeeId)

    def unfollow(self, followerId: int, followeeId: int) -> None:
        if followeeId in self.followMap[followerId]:
            self.followMap[followerId].remove(followeeId)
```



## FIND MEDIAN FROM DATA STREAM

The median is the middle value in an ordered integer list. If the size of the list is even, there is no middle value, and the median is the mean of the two middle values.
For example, for arr = [2,3,4], the median is 3.
For example, for arr = [2,3], the median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5.
Implement the MedianFinder class:
MedianFinder() initializes the MedianFinder object.
void addNum(int num) adds the integer num from the data stream to the data structure.
double findMedian() returns the median of all elements so far. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.

Example 1:

Input
["MedianFinder", "addNum", "addNum", "findMedian", "addNum", "findMedian"]
[[], [1], [2], [], [3], []]
Output
[null, null, null, 1.5, null, 2.0]

Explanation
MedianFinder medianFinder = new MedianFinder();
medianFinder.addNum(1);    // arr = [1]
medianFinder.addNum(2);    // arr = [1, 2]
medianFinder.findMedian(); // return 1.5 (i.e., (1 + 2) / 2)
medianFinder.addNum(3);    // arr[1, 2, 3]
medianFinder.findMedian(); // return 2.0

Constraints:

-105 <= num <= 105
There will be at least one element in the data structure before calling findMedian.
At most 5 * 104 calls will be made to addNum and findMedian.

Follow up:

If all integer numbers from the stream are in the range [0, 100], how would you optimize your solution?
If 99% of all integer numbers from the stream are in the range [0, 100], how would you optimize your solution?

### solution

```python
class MedianFinder:
    def __init__(self):
        """
        initialize your data structure here.
        """
        # two heaps, large, small, minheap, maxheap
        # heaps should be equal size
        self.small, self.large = [], []  # maxHeap, minHeap (python default)

    def addNum(self, num: int) -> None:
        heapq.heappush(self.small, -1 * num)

        if self.small and self.large and (-1 * self.small[0]) > self.large[0]:
            val = -1 * heapq.heappop(self.small)
            heapq.heappush(self.large, val)

        if len(self.small) > len(self.large) + 1:
            val = -1 * heapq.heappop(self.small)
            heapq.heappush(self.large, val)
        if len(self.large) > len(self.small) + 1:
            val = heapq.heappop(self.large)
            heapq.heappush(self.small, -1 * val)

    def findMedian(self) -> float:
        if len(self.small) > len(self.large):
            return -1 * self.small[0]
        elif len(self.large) > len(self.small):
            return self.large[0]
        return (-1 * self.small[0] + self.large[0]) / 2
```
