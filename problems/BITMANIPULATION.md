## SINGLE NUMBER
Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,2,1]
Output: 1

Example 2:
Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1

Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
-3 * 104 <= nums[i] <= 3 * 104
Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.

### solution
```python
class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        res = 0
        for n in nums:
            res = n ^ res
        return res
```

## NUMBER OF 1 BITS
Write a function that takes the binary representation of an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).
Note:
Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, the input will be given as a signed integer type. It should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.
In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using 2's complement notation. Therefore, in Example 3, the input represents the signed integer. -3.
 
Example 1:
Input: n = 00000000000000000000000000001011
Output: 3
Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000000001011 has a total of three '1' bits.

Example 2:
Input: n = 00000000000000000000000010000000
Output: 1
Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000010000000 has a total of one '1' bit.

Example 3:
Input: n = 11111111111111111111111111111101
Output: 31
Explanation: The input binary string 11111111111111111111111111111101 has a total of thirty one '1' bits.
 
Constraints:
The input must be a binary string of length 32.

### solution
```python
class Solution:
    def hammingWeight(self, n: int) -> int:
        res = 0
        while n:
            n &= n - 1
            res += 1
        return res
```

## COUNTING BITS
Given an integer n, return an array ans of length n + 1 such that for each i (0 <= i <= n), ans[i] is the number of 1's in the binary representation of i.

Example 1:
Input: n = 2
Output: [0,1,1]
Explanation:
0 --> 0
1 --> 1
2 --> 10

Example 2:
Input: n = 5
Output: [0,1,1,2,1,2]
Explanation:
0 --> 0
1 --> 1
2 --> 10
3 --> 11
4 --> 100
5 --> 101
 
Constraints:
0 <= n <= 105

### solution
```python
class Solution:
    def countBits(self, n: int) -> List[int]:
        dp = [0] * (n + 1)
        offset = 1

        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if offset * 2 == i:
                offset = i
            dp[i] = 1 + dp[i - offset]
        return dp
```

## REVERSE BITS
Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.
Note:
Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, both input and output will be given as a signed integer type. They should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.
In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using 2's complement notation. Therefore, in Example 2 above, the input represents the signed integer -3 and the output represents the signed integer -1073741825.

Example 1:
Input: n = 00000010100101000001111010011100
Output:    964176192 (00111001011110000010100101000000)
Explanation: The input binary string 00000010100101000001111010011100 represents the unsigned integer 43261596, so return 964176192 which its binary representation is 00111001011110000010100101000000.

Example 2:
Input: n = 11111111111111111111111111111101
Output:   3221225471 (10111111111111111111111111111111)
Explanation: The input binary string 11111111111111111111111111111101 represents the unsigned integer 4294967293, so return 3221225471 which its binary representation is 10111111111111111111111111111111.
 
Constraints:
The input must be a binary string of length 32

### solution
```python
class Solution:
    def reverseBits(self, n: int) -> int:
        res = 0
        for i in range(32):
            bit = (n >> i) & 1
            res += (bit << (31 - i))
        return res

```

## MISSING NUMBER
Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 2 since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,2]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
Output: 8
Explanation: n = 9 since there are 9 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,9]. 8 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

Constraints:
n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 104
0 <= nums[i] <= n
All the numbers of nums are unique.

### solution
```python
class Solution:
    def missingNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        res = len(nums)

        for i in range(len(nums)):
            res += i - nums[i]
        return res
```

## SUM OF TWO INTEGERS
Given two integers a and b, return the sum of the two integers without using the operators + and -.

Example 1:
Input: a = 1, b = 2
Output: 3

Example 2:
Input: a = 2, b = 3
Output: 5

Constraints:
-1000 <= a, b <= 1000

### solution
```python
class Solution:
    def getSum(self, a: int, b: int) -> int:
        def add(a, b):
            if not a or not b:
                return a or b
            return add(a ^ b, (a & b) << 1)

        if a * b < 0:  # assume a < 0, b > 0
            if a > 0:
                return self.getSum(b, a)
            if add(~a, 1) == b:  # -a == b
                return 0
            if add(~a, 1) < b:  # -a < b
                return add(~add(add(~a, 1), add(~b, 1)), 1)  # -add(-a, -b)

        return add(a, b)  # a*b >= 0 or (-a) > b > 0
```

## REVERSE INTEGER
Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then return 0.
Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).

Example 1:
Input: x = 123
Output: 321
Example 2:

Input: x = -123
Output: -321

Example 3:
Input: x = 120
Output: 21

Constraints:
-231 <= x <= 231 - 1

### solution

```python
class Solution:
    def reverse(self, x: int) -> int:
        # Integer.MAX_VALUE = 2147483647 (end with 7)
        # Integer.MIN_VALUE = -2147483648 (end with -8 )

        MIN = -2147483648  # -2^31,
        MAX = 2147483647  #  2^31 - 1

        res = 0
        while x:
            digit = int(math.fmod(x, 10))  # (python dumb) -1 %  10 = 9
            x = int(x / 10)  # (python dumb) -1 // 10 = -1

            if res > MAX // 10 or (res == MAX // 10 and digit > MAX % 10):
                return 0
            if res < MIN // 10 or (res == MIN // 10 and digit < MIN % 10):
                return 0
            res = (res * 10) + digit

        return res
