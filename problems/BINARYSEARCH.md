## BINARY SEARCH

Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.
You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9
Output: 4
Explanation: 9 exists in nums and its index is 4

Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: 2 does not exist in nums so return -1

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 104
-104 < nums[i], target < 104
All the integers in nums are unique.
nums is sorted in ascending order.

### solution

```python
class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        l, r = 0, len(nums) - 1

        while l <= r:
            m = l + ((r - l) // 2)  # (l + r) // 2 can lead to overflow
            if nums[m] > target:
                r = m - 1
            elif nums[m] < target:
                l = m + 1
            else:
                return m
        return -1
```



## SEARCH A 2D MATRIX

Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value target in an m x n integer matrix matrix. This matrix has the following properties:
Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.
The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

Example 1:

Input: matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], target = 3
Output: true

Example 2:

Input: matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], target = 13
Output: false

Constraints:

m == matrix.length
n == matrix[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 100
-104 <= matrix[i][j], target <= 104

### solution

```python
class Solution:
    def searchMatrix(self, matrix: List[List[int]], target: int) -> bool:
        ROWS, COLS = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])

        top, bot = 0, ROWS - 1
        while top <= bot:
            row = (top + bot) // 2
            if target > matrix[row][-1]:
                top = row + 1
            elif target < matrix[row][0]:
                bot = row - 1
            else:
                break

        if not (top <= bot):
            return False
        row = (top + bot) // 2
        l, r = 0, COLS - 1
        while l <= r:
            m = (l + r) // 2
            if target > matrix[row][m]:
                l = m + 1
            elif target < matrix[row][m]:
                r = m - 1
            else:
                return True
        return False
```



## KOKO EATING BANANAS

Koko loves to eat bananas. There are n piles of bananas, the ith pile has piles[i] bananas. The guards have gone and will come back in h hours.
Koko can decide her bananas-per-hour eating speed of k. Each hour, she chooses some pile of bananas and eats k bananas from that pile. If the pile has less than k bananas, she eats all of them instead and will not eat any more bananas during this hour.
Koko likes to eat slowly but still wants to finish eating all the bananas before the guards return.
Return the minimum integer k such that she can eat all the bananas within h hours.

Example 1:

Input: piles = [3,6,7,11], h = 8
Output: 4

Example 2:

Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 5
Output: 30
Example 3:

Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 6
Output: 23

Constraints:

1 <= piles.length <= 104
piles.length <= h <= 109
1 <= piles[i] <= 109

### solution

```python
class Solution:
    def minEatingSpeed(self, piles: List[int], h: int) -> int:
        l, r = 1, max(piles)
        res = max(piles)

        while l <= r:
            k = (l + r) // 2

            totalTime = 0
            for p in piles:
                totalTime += math.ceil(p / k)
            if totalTime <= h:
                res = min(res, k)
                r = k - 1
            else:
                l = k + 1
        return res
```

## FIND MINIMUM IN ROTATED SORTED ARRAY

Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become:
[4,5,6,7,0,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.
[0,1,2,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.
Notice that rotating an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 1 time results in the array [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]].
Given the sorted rotated array nums of unique elements, return the minimum element of this array.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4 times.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [11,13,15,17]
Output: 11
Explanation: The original array was [11,13,15,17] and it was rotated 4 times. 

Constraints:

n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 5000
-5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000
All the integers of nums are unique.
nums is sorted and rotated between 1 and n times.

### solution

```python
class Solution:
    def findMin(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        start , end = 0, len(nums) - 1 
        curr_min = float("inf")
        
        while start  <  end :
            mid = (start + end ) // 2
            curr_min = min(curr_min,nums[mid])
            
            # right has the min 
            if nums[mid] > nums[end]:
                start = mid + 1
                
            # left has the  min 
            else:
                end = mid - 1 
                
        return min(curr_min,nums[start])
```


## SEARCH IN ROTATED SORTED ARRAY

There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).
Prior to being passed to your function, nums is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index k (1 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 3 and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].
Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.
You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4

Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1

Example 3:

Input: nums = [1], target = 0
Output: -1

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 5000
-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
All values of nums are unique.
nums is an ascending array that is possibly rotated.
-10^4 <= target <= 10^4

### solution

```python
class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        l, r = 0, len(nums) - 1

        while l <= r:
            mid = (l + r) // 2
            if target == nums[mid]:
                return mid

            # left sorted portion
            if nums[l] <= nums[mid]:
                if target > nums[mid] or target < nums[l]:
                    l = mid + 1
                else:
                    r = mid - 1
            # right sorted portion
            else:
                if target < nums[mid] or target > nums[r]:
                    r = mid - 1
                else:
                    l = mid + 1
        return -1
```


## TIME BASED KEY-VALUE STORE

 Design a time-based key-value data structure that can store multiple values for the same key at different time stamps and retrieve the key's value at a certain timestamp.
 Implement the TimeMap class:
 TimeMap() Initializes the object of the data structure.
 void set(String key, String value, int timestamp) Stores the key key with the value value at the given time timestamp.
 String get(String key, int timestamp) Returns a value such that set was called previously, with timestamp_prev <= timestamp. If there are multiple such values, it returns the value associated with the largest timestamp_prev. If there are no values, it returns "".

 Example 1:

 Input
 ["TimeMap", "set", "get", "get", "set", "get", "get"]
 [[], ["foo", "bar", 1], ["foo", 1], ["foo", 3], ["foo", "bar2", 4], ["foo", 4], ["foo", 5]]
 Output
 [null, null, "bar", "bar", null, "bar2", "bar2"]

 Explanation
 TimeMap timeMap = new TimeMap();
 timeMap.set("foo", "bar", 1);  // store the key "foo" and value "bar" along with timestamp = 1.
 timeMap.get("foo", 1);         // return "bar"
 timeMap.get("foo", 3);         // return "bar", since there is no value corresponding to foo at timestamp 3 and timestamp 2, then the only value is at timestamp 1 is "bar".
 timeMap.set("foo", "bar2", 4); // store the key "foo" and value "bar2" along with timestamp = 4.
 timeMap.get("foo", 4);         // return "bar2"
 timeMap.get("foo", 5);         // return "bar2"

 Constraints:

 1 <= key.length, value.length <= 100
 key and value consist of lowercase English letters and digits.
 1 <= timestamp <= 10^7
 All the timestamps timestamp of set are strictly increasing.
 At most 2 * 10^5 calls will be made to set and get.

### solution

```python
class TimeMap:
    def __init__(self):
        """
        Initialize your data structure here.
        """
        self.keyStore = {}  # key : list of [val, timestamp]

    def set(self, key: str, value: str, timestamp: int) -> None:
        if key not in self.keyStore:
            self.keyStore[key] = []
        self.keyStore[key].append([value, timestamp])

    def get(self, key: str, timestamp: int) -> str:
        res, values = "", self.keyStore.get(key, [])
        l, r = 0, len(values) - 1
        while l <= r:
            m = (l + r) // 2
            if values[m][1] <= timestamp:
                res = values[m][0]
                l = m + 1
            else:
                r = m - 1
        return res
```



## MEDIAN OF TWO SORTED ARRAYS

Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays.
The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).

Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [1,3], nums2 = [2]
Output: 2.00000
Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3] and median is 2.

Example 2:

Input: nums1 = [1,2], nums2 = [3,4]
Output: 2.50000
Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3,4] and median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5.

Constraints:

nums1.length == m
nums2.length == n
0 <= m <= 1000
0 <= n <= 1000
1 <= m + n <= 2000
-106 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 106

### solution

```python
class Solution:
    def findMedianSortedArrays(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> float:
        A, B = nums1, nums2
        total = len(nums1) + len(nums2)
        half = total // 2

        if len(B) < len(A):
            A, B = B, A

        l, r = 0, len(A) - 1
        while True:
            i = (l + r) // 2  # A
            j = half - i - 2  # B

            Aleft = A[i] if i >= 0 else float("-infinity")
            Aright = A[i + 1] if (i + 1) < len(A) else float("infinity")
            Bleft = B[j] if j >= 0 else float("-infinity")
            Bright = B[j + 1] if (j + 1) < len(B) else float("infinity")

            # partition is correct
            if Aleft <= Bright and Bleft <= Aright:
                # odd
                if total % 2:
                    return min(Aright, Bright)
                # even
                return (max(Aleft, Bleft) + min(Aright, Bright)) / 2
            elif Aleft > Bright:
                r = i - 1
            else:
                l = i + 1
```
