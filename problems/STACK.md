## VALID PARENTHESES

Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.
An input string is valid if:
Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

Example 1:

Input: s = "()"
Output: true

Example 2:

Input: s = "()[]{}"
Output: true

Example 3:

Input: s = "(]"
Output: false

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 104
s consists of parentheses only '()[]{}'.

### solution

```python
class Solution:
    def isValid(self, s: str) -> bool:
        Map = {")": "(", "]": "[", "}": "{"}
        stack = []

        for c in s:
            if c not in Map:
                stack.append(c)
                continue
            if not stack or stack[-1] != Map[c]:
                return False
            stack.pop()

        return not stack
```


## MIN STACK

Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.
Implement the MinStack class:
MinStack() initializes the stack object.
void push(int val) pushes the element val onto the stack.
void pop() removes the element on the top of the stack.
int top() gets the top element of the stack.
int getMin() retrieves the minimum element in the stack.
You must implement a solution with O(1) time complexity for each function.

Example 1:

Input
["MinStack","push","push","push","getMin","pop","top","getMin"]
[[],[-2],[0],[-3],[],[],[],[]]

Output
[null,null,null,null,-3,null,0,-2]

Explanation
MinStack minStack = new MinStack();
minStack.push(-2);
minStack.push(0);
minStack.push(-3);
minStack.getMin(); // return -3
minStack.pop();
minStack.top();    // return 0
minStack.getMin(); // return -2

Constraints:

-231 <= val <= 231 - 1
Methods pop, top and getMin operations will always be called on non-empty stacks.
At most 3 * 104 calls will be made to push, pop, top, and getMin.

### solution

```python
class MinStack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.stack = []
        self.minStack = []

    def push(self, val: int) -> None:
        self.stack.append(val)
        val = min(val, self.minStack[-1] if self.minStack else val)
        self.minStack.append(val)

    def pop(self) -> None:
        self.stack.pop()
        self.minStack.pop()

    def top(self) -> int:
        return self.stack[-1]

    def getMin(self) -> int:
        return self.minStack[-1]
```


## EVALUATE REVERSE POLISH NOTATION

Evaluate the value of an arithmetic expression in Reverse Polish Notation.
Valid operators are +, -, *, and /. Each operand may be an integer or another expression.
Note that division between two integers should truncate toward zero.
It is guaranteed that the given RPN expression is always valid. That means the expression would always evaluate to a result, and there will not be any division by zero operation.

Example 1:

Input: tokens = ["2","1","+","3","*"]
Output: 9
Explanation: ((2 + 1) * 3) = 9

Example 2:

Input: tokens = ["4","13","5","/","+"]
Output: 6
Explanation: (4 + (13 / 5)) = 6

Example 3:

Input: tokens = ["10","6","9","3","+","-11","*","/","*","17","+","5","+"]
Output: 22
Explanation: ((10 * (6 / ((9 + 3) * -11))) + 17) + 5
= ((10 * (6 / (12 * -11))) + 17) + 5
= ((10 * (6 / -132)) + 17) + 5
= ((10 * 0) + 17) + 5
= (0 + 17) + 5
= 17 + 5
= 22

Constraints:

1 <= tokens.length <= 104
tokens[i] is either an operator: "+", "-", "*", or "/", or an integer in the range [-200, 200].

### solution

```python
class Solution:
    def evalRPN(self, tokens: List[str]) -> int:
        stack = []
        for c in tokens:
            if c == "+":
                stack.append(stack.pop() + stack.pop())
            elif c == "-":
                a, b = stack.pop(), stack.pop()
                stack.append(b - a)
            elif c == "*":
                stack.append(stack.pop() * stack.pop())
            elif c == "/":
                a, b = stack.pop(), stack.pop()
                stack.append(int(b / a))
            else:
                stack.append(int(c))
        return stack[0]
```


## GENERATE PARENTHESES

Given n pairs of parentheses, write a function to generate all combinations of well-formed parentheses.

Example 1:

Input: n = 3
Output: ["((()))","(()())","(())()","()(())","()()()"]

Example 2:

Input: n = 1
Output: ["()"]

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 8

### solution

```python
class Solution:
    def generateParenthesis(self, n: int) -> List[str]:
        stack = []
        res = []

        def backtrack(openN, closedN):
            if openN == closedN == n:
                res.append("".join(stack))
                return

            if openN < n:
                stack.append("(")
                backtrack(openN + 1, closedN)
                stack.pop()
            if closedN < openN:
                stack.append(")")
                backtrack(openN, closedN + 1)
                stack.pop()

        backtrack(0, 0)
        return res
```


## DAILY TEMPERATURES

Given an array of integers temperatures represents the daily temperatures, return an array answer such that answer[i] is the number of days you have to wait after the ith day to get a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, keep answer[i] == 0 instead.

Example 1:

Input: temperatures = [73,74,75,71,69,72,76,73]
Output: [1,1,4,2,1,1,0,0]

Example 2:

Input: temperatures = [30,40,50,60]
Output: [1,1,1,0]

Example 3:

Input: temperatures = [30,60,90]
Output: [1,1,0]

Constraints:

1 <= temperatures.length <= 105
30 <= temperatures[i] <= 100

### solution

```python
class Solution:
    def dailyTemperatures(self, temperatures: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        res = [0] * len(temperatures)
        stack = []  # pair: [temp, index]

        for i, t in enumerate(temperatures):
            while stack and t > stack[-1][0]:
                stackT, stackInd = stack.pop()
                res[stackInd] = i - stackInd
            stack.append((t, i))
        return res
```


## CAR FLEET

There are n cars going to the same destination along a one-lane road. The destination is target miles away.
You are given two integer array position and speed, both of length n, where position[i] is the position of the ith car and speed[i] is the speed of the ith car (in miles per hour).
A car can never pass another car ahead of it, but it can catch up to it and drive bumper to bumper at the same speed. The faster car will slow down to match the slower car's speed. The distance between these two cars is ignored (i.e., they are assumed to have the same position).
A car fleet is some non-empty set of cars driving at the same position and same speed. Note that a single car is also a car fleet.
If a car catches up to a car fleet right at the destination point, it will still be considered as one car fleet.
Return the number of car fleets that will arrive at the destination.

Example 1:

Input: target = 12, position = [10,8,0,5,3], speed = [2,4,1,1,3]
Output: 3
Explanation:
The cars starting at 10 (speed 2) and 8 (speed 4) become a fleet, meeting each other at 12.
The car starting at 0 does not catch up to any other car, so it is a fleet by itself.
The cars starting at 5 (speed 1) and 3 (speed 3) become a fleet, meeting each other at 6. The fleet moves at speed 1 until it reaches target.
Note that no other cars meet these fleets before the destination, so the answer is 3.

Example 2:

Input: target = 10, position = [3], speed = [3]
Output: 1
Explanation: There is only one car, hence there is only one fleet.

Example 3:

Input: target = 100, position = [0,2,4], speed = [4,2,1]
Output: 1
Explanation:
The cars starting at 0 (speed 4) and 2 (speed 2) become a fleet, meeting each other at 4. The fleet moves at speed 2.
Then, the fleet (speed 2) and the car starting at 4 (speed 1) become one fleet, meeting each other at 6. The fleet moves at speed 1 until it reaches target.

Constraints:

n == position.length == speed.length
1 <= n <= 105
0 < target <= 106
0 <= position[i] < target
All the values of position are unique.
0 < speed[i] <= 106

### solution

```python
class Solution:
    def carFleet(self, target: int, position: List[int], speed: List[int]) -> int:
        pair = [(p, s) for p, s in zip(position, speed)]
        pair.sort(reverse=True)
        stack = []
        for p, s in pair:  # Reverse Sorted Order
            stack.append((target - p) / s)
            if len(stack) >= 2 and stack[-1] <= stack[-2]:
                stack.pop()
        return len(stack)
```


## LARGEST RECTANGLE IN HISTOGRAM

Given an array of integers heights representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is 1, return the area of the largest rectangle in the histogram.

Example 1:

Input: heights = [2,1,5,6,2,3]
Output: 10
Explanation: The above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1.
The largest rectangle is shown in the red area, which has an area = 10 units.

Example 2:

Input: heights = [2,4]
Output: 4

Constraints:

1 <= heights.length <= 105
0 <= heights[i] <= 104

### solution

```python
class Solution:
    def largestRectangleArea(self, heights: List[int]) -> int:
        maxArea = 0
        stack = []  # pair: (index, height)

        for i, h in enumerate(heights):
            start = i
            while stack and stack[-1][1] > h:
                index, height = stack.pop()
                maxArea = max(maxArea, height * (i - index))
                start = index
            stack.append((start, h))

        for i, h in stack:
            maxArea = max(maxArea, h * (len(heights) - i))
        return maxArea
```
